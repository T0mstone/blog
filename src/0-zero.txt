The first post -- A small step for mankind, one giant leap for a man
This is my first blog post. Today I had the idea "hey, I could write a blog."
I'd like to thank GitHub for making GitHub Pages free to use. It is such a great thing to have your own\
Website, free of charge! 
I will be improving this blog in the future and there will be more content \
(I'm planning on releasing some educational content here).
For now though, that's it. 
Thank you for reading and have a nice day.
